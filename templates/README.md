_Food ResQ_  by **Binary Brains** 

*Problem Statement:* \
For many people in the world, food waste has become a habit:\
buying more food than we need at markets, letting fruits and
vegetables spoil in the fridge.
These habits put extra strain on our natural resources and
damage our environment. When we waste food, we waste the
labour, effort, investment and precious resources (like water,
seeds, feed, etc.) that go into producing it, not to mention the
resources that go into transporting and processing it. In short,
wasting food increases greenhouse gas emissions and contributes
to climate change.\
Reducing food loss and waste is essential in a world where
millions of people go hungry every day.\
To reduce this, develop an application which keeps track of what is
in your fridge with expiry dates.\

Features to be implemented :\
->Input to the application can be item name and its expiry date.\
->It should notify if any item has its expiry date coming.\
->It should give you the recipes that can be prepared using the
  items in the fridge.\
->Recommend food items based on previous purchases/expired
  items.\
